## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the emotional tone behind textual data. This project utilizes the GoEmotions dataset, a comprehensive collection of human-annotated Reddit comments categorized into 27 emotion labels, to fine-tune DistilBERTâ€”a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT.

## Dataset

The [GoEmotions dataset](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/goemotions) consists of approximately 58,000 Reddit comments labeled across 27 emotion categories, including happiness, sadness, anger, and more. This rich dataset enables the development of models capable of nuanced emotion detection.

## Model

[DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) is a distilled version of BERT, retaining 97% of its language understanding while being 60% faster and lighter. Fine-tuning DistilBERT on the GoEmotions dataset allows for efficient and effective sentiment analysis.
